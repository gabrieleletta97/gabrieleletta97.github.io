Since 2023, I have been part of the **organizing committee** of the [Milan PhD Economic Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/milanphdeconworkshop/home), an annual academic event gathering PhD students from the universities in Milan and its whereabouts to present and discuss their research in economics.
I served as an organizing committee member in the 1st ([2023](https://sites.google.com/view/milanphdeconworkshop/past-events/2023-workshop-unimi)), the 2nd ([2024](https://sites.google.com/view/milanphdeconworkshop/past-events/2024-workshop-unimib))
and the the 3rd edition ([2025](https://sites.google.com/view/milanphdeconworkshop/home)).
