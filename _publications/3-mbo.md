This paper studies the impact of two distinct policy interventions on scientific research productivity in a major private Italian hospital. The first is a performance-based monetary incentive program (a Management-By-Objectives or MBO bonus) introduced by the hospital management to reward non-academic physicians for publishing research. The second is the hospital’s recognition as an *Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico* (IRCCS), which allowed its academic medical researchers to access earmarked public research funding. Using detailed panel data on physicians’ publications from 2012 to 2022, we employ several difference-in-differences strategies to evaluate each policy’s effect. We find that the introduction of monetary incentives did not lead to any significant effect in research output by previously less research-active (non-academic) physicians, unless they were both treated by the MBO policy and had also access to IRCCS funding (``double-treated''). The IRCCS recognition caused instead a major boost in the publication rates of academic doctors and Medical Directors affected by both policies. We detect no evidence that these incentives affected research quality in the short run, as the additional publications did not have any significant impact on citations. We also document increased cross-collaboration between the incentivized groups, indicating the emergence of knowledge spillovers. These findings inform the design of policies to stimulate research in healthcare organizations, highlighting the lesser significance of performance-based performance incentives in absence of adequate research funding means.
