This study investigates the role of counselling in shaping decision-making for women contemplating a vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC) or elective repeat cesarean section (ERCS). We employed a structured questionnaire administered to women eligible for VBAC at Gemelli Hospital during 2023. The questionnaire was designed, drawing from academic literature, to explore past delivery experiences, individual perceptions of risks and benefits, and the influence of information provided by healthcare professionals, in conjunction with socio-demographic factors. Our findings reveal that age, education, counselling satisfaction, and prior beliefs about natural birth influence the probability of VBAC, while factors related to the previous cesarean delivery are not relevant.
